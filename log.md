# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 08, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Started with React JS, Angular & Vue JS - Quickstart & Comparison

**Thoughts:** Having worked with an inhouse javascript mvc framework (built & used internally within my client) for almost 3.5 years, I have taken the step forward to learn in depth about the big 3 open source javascript frameworks available today 

### Day 1: May 09, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Implemented a TODO app in Vue Js with add & remove functionality

**Thoughts:** Surprised that v-html in Vue js can only work with setting the html as string in vue data. Have to find a way if it can be hardcoded in the template itself. Eg. for mDash I had to set in data mDash: '\u2014' and do v-html="mDash" in template.

### Day 2: May 10, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Virtual dom & shadow dom

**Thoughts:** Virtual DOM is a pattern, which handles efficient DOM repainting . Shadow DOM is a draft W3C standard in work. 

### Day 3: May 11, 2018 


**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learnt & coded for template conditions, dynamic classes & short hands for directives 
2. Register a component in Vue


**Thoughts:** Pretty straight forward. Vue.component registration should be done before the new Vue else it throws error 'did you register the component correctly'
